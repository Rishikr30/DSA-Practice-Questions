# DSA Learning with C

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository! This repository contains the solutions to various DSA problems that I have solved while learning the concepts from scratch using the C programming language.

## About

This repository serves as a personal collection of DSA problems and their solutions. The problems range from basic to advanced levels, covering different topics in data structures and algorithms. Each solution is implemented in C, and I have provided comments and explanations to make the code easy to understand.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on the type of data structure or algorithm. Each folder contains multiple problem files, and each file includes:

- Problem statement
- Solution in C
- Comments and explanations

## Topics Covered

Here are some of the topics covered in this repository:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## How to Use

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishikr30/DSA-Learning-with-C.git
```

Navigate to the folder of your choice to find the problems and solutions related to that topic. You can compile and run the C programs using any C compiler.
